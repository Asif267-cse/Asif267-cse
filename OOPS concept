## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++: Classes and Objects

### **Overview**

This repository contains a basic example of how to implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. The focus of this code is on demonstrating the use of **classes** and **objects**, which are fundamental building blocks in OOP.

### **Code Explanation**

The provided code defines a simple `Student` class to illustrate key OOP principles:

- **Class Definition**:
  - **Properties**: The `Student` class has four properties: `name`, `id`, `department`, and `age`. These attributes represent the state of a student object.
  - **Methods**: Two methods are included:
    - `change_dep()`: Updates the department of the student.
    - `get_info()`: Displays the student's information.

- **Main Function**:
  - An object of the `Student` class, named `student1`, is created.
  - The properties of `student1` are initialized, and its details are displayed using the `get_info()` method.
  - The `change_dep()` method is used to update the department, and the updated details are displayed.

### **Code Example**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student
{
public:
    // Properties
    string name;
    string id;
    string department;
    int age;

    // Methods
    void change_dep(string dep)
    {
        department = dep;
    }

    void get_info()
    {
        cout << "Student name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Student ID: " << id << endl;
        cout << "Department: " << department << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    // Creating an object of the Student class
    Student student1;

    // Setting properties
    student1.name = "Asif Saeed";
    student1.id = "267";
    student1.department = "Computer Science";
    student1.age = 20;

    // Displaying student information
    student1.get_info();

    // Changing department
    student1.change_dep("Mathematics");

    // Displaying updated student information
    student1.get_info();

    return 0;
}
```

### **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. **Compile and Run**:
   - Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o studentApp`.
   - Run the executable, e.g., `./studentApp`.
